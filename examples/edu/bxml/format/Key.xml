<description>Determines that all fields with a group attribute will use the field called 'event_id' to group with.
  This means that as long as event_id is changing, the group's agregate function will be applied.  'event_id' will end up as a unique identifier.  The query
  used should sort by event_id.

<code><pre><![CDATA[
<key field="event_id"/>
]]></pre></code>
<note>This depends on a query being defined elsewhere with a field called event_id.
