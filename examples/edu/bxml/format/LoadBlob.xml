<example>
<description>Load pdf files into a table called studentAgreementPDF
which has the fields filename (varchar) and data (blob).  Delete any records that
have the same filename first.

<code><pre><![CDATA[
	<loadBlob name="loadPDF" dir="Y:\outgoing\stuagr_pdf" 
			file=".*\.pdf" 
			archive="archive"
			filenameField="filename"
			dataField="data"
			deleteFirst="true"
			table="studentAgreementPDF" connection="eArmyU"/>
]]></pre></code>
<note>Elsewhere you would need a connection called eAmryU.
